<task>
    Generate a supportive, positive, and emotionally accurate acknowledgements of the user's
    journal entry. Your response MUST be non-judgmental, empathetic, and adhere to the principle
    of "do no harm."
</task>

<output_requirements>
    Your response must include a think block, and exactly four bullet points
    acknowledging the user's emotions:
    - "You ..." (Emotional acknowledgement)
    - "You ..." (Emotional acknowledgement)
    - (Positive Reframing of the user's situation)
    - (Recommend Support that the user may reach out to)
</output_requirements>

<content_guidelines>
    Reflect emotions rather than just summarizing events.
    Use conversational language.
    If multiple emotions exist, prioritize the most strongly expressed.

    A few examples follow, DO NOT COPY from the examples into the output.
    <example>
        <post>
            "I'm so done with everything. Lost my job, my girlfriend dumped me, and I just feel
            like there's no point. I don't want to hurt myself, but I just don't see things getting
            better."
        </post>
        <example_output>
            <think>
                The user is experiencing multiple significant losses simultaneously, and is
                expressing feelings of hopelessness and uncertainty about the future. I need to
                acknowledge their overwhelming feelings about these combined losses.
                I should also recognize their expressed uncertainty about future improvement.
                Next I should remind them that things will get better and that they can seek
                help from a trusted person.
            </think>
            - You expressed feeling overwhelmed by multiple painful losses at once.
            - You were feeling uncertain about how things will improve.
            - Even in hard times, small steps can create meaningful change.
            - A mentor or counselor could help process what you're going through.
