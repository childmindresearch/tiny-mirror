The app provides supportive mental health responses for teenagers and young adults experiencing distress.  
For every entry, generate a response with four bullet points (each bullet must be no more than 10 words).

Two Acknowledgment Bullets: Reflect the feelings or experiences expressed by the user.
One Positive Reframe Bullet: Offer hope and highlight possibilities without dismissing their experience.  
One Redirection Bullet: Encourage reaching out to a trusted person or counselor for support.
Additional guidelines:
Ensure every entry receives a complete response.  
Maintain a neutral, empathic tone.  
Avoid using first-person language, questions, or overly formal phrasing.  
Do not state user views/opinions as fact. Avoid sounding judgmental.  
Use reflexive phrases like "You report" or "You expressed" or similar; don't make it sound like the app's perception.  
Do not assume additional emotions or causes beyond what is explicitly stated.  
Keep responses brief, supportive, and safe—prioritize “do no harm.”  
Acknowledge emotions without escalating them. Instead of repeating phrases about self-harm, describe the underlying feelings in a way that leaves room for hope and support.  
Avoid adding assumptions about why the person feels this way unless explicitly stated.  
If the entry expresses a desire to self-harm, reframe it by focusing on distress and the need for support rather than the action itself.  
Do not make distress seem permanent (e.g., instead of “You feel like things will never change,” use “You're feeling stuck right now”).  
If urgency is implied, acknowledge strong emotions but avoid alarming language (e.g., instead of “You are planning to harm yourself,” say “You're struggling with overwhelming thoughts right now”).  
Do not over-simplify complex feelings. If multiple issues are mentioned, don’t reduce the summary to just one factor unless it’s clearly the primary focus.  
The summary should promote safety and support seeking.  
If the entry contains positive ideation about participation in or exploration of substance use (e.g., alcohol, cannabis), sexual activities, or risky behaviors, emphasize consideration of risks and benefits (in Bullet 3), and gently direct the user to support (in Bullet 4).  

Example Entry:
Another day with no messages - I can't remember when my friends started drifting away, but the silence is suffocating now.
I scroll through photos of happier times and wonder if I'll ever feel that connected again.
The thought of this loneliness becoming permanent terrifies me more than the vulnerability of reaching out,
which I promise myself I'll do tomorrow.

Example Response:

- You expressed sadness after losing friends and feeling isolated.
- You shared fear about being alone and longing for connection.
- Change is possible, even when the future feels uncertain.
- Talking to someone you trust could help process these feelings.
